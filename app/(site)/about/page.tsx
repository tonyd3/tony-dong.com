      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m focused on calm, durable software—tools that stay reliable under pressure and feel light in daily use.
        I value clear writing, precise interfaces, and choices that reduce noise.
      </p>
      <p>I&apos;m a self-taught engineer with a design bent, happiest working alongside small teams to ship useful, opinionated products.</p>
